The museum presented the war from multiple perspectives, including the Vietnamese, the Americans, and the Viet Cong. though it was a bit interesting our tour guide to join us in the museum it was harder to learn .I wouldn't recommend as it was 4 hours and a bit boring but the next activity was great and chaotic fun .We went on a motor cycle food tour. At first i thought I'm gonna die I'm not doing this at all but then the engine suddenly revved and my motor driver was on the road ,my body tensed up and i clinged for dear life but then i slowly got used to it and felt safe and we arrive at our first stop ,our entree",

  "afternoon": "Today we made plushies, it was in a small shop called Hoi Hoi Project. First, we started off by picking the template for the shape of the plushie. Caitlyn and I (Yeshara) picked a bunny shape, and Shenara picked a bear shape. After we chose a template, we started sewing—it was a very long process and took about 45 minutes. Then we flipped it inside out, and we started stuffing the plushie from a small gap we had left when sewing. Finally, we began putting the accessories on. They had many charms to choose from, and we were only allowed 10. When we were done, we put the plushie in a box, gave it a cool birth certificate, and got some mini perfume for our teddy"
