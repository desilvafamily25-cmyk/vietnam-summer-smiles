  "morning": "We woke up SO early this morning because we had something really exciting planned — KAYAKING! The water was so calm and beautiful, like a giant mirror reflecting all the limestone islands. Uncle Peter was super brave and went solo kayaking all by himself! The rest of us jumped into a big paddle boat together and it was so much fun paddling through the emerald green water. We could see fish swimming below us and the towering rocks all around us looked like something from a fairy tale. The morning mist made everything look magical and mysterious. We took so many photos because it was just TOO beautiful! 📸",

  "afternoon": "After our kayaking adventure, we headed back to the cruise ship for the most AMAZING final brunch! There was so much delicious food — fresh fruit, pastries, eggs, and Vietnamese dishes. We ate while watching the beautiful bay pass by through the big windows. Then it was time to say goodbye to our floating home. We packed up our bags and the cruise brought us back to the port. Our luxury van was waiting for us, and we started the 3-hour journey back to Hanoi. We were all a bit tired from the early morning, so some of us had a little nap in the comfy van! 😴",

  "evening": "When we got back to our hotel in Hanoi, we had the BEST surprise waiting for us — a trip to a nearby spa! The three of us (Caitlyn, Yeshara and Shenara) got to have a proper head massage and hair wash. It was such a different experience! The ladies were so gentle and the massage felt amazing after our big kayaking adventure. Our hair felt so soft and shiny afterwards, and we couldn't stop smiling. It was the perfect way to relax after two incredible days on Halong Bay! 💆‍♀️✨",
