When walks d around there was loads of different mouth watering foods like a seafood platter , all types of meat ,pho ,pastries , mousse and many more scrumptious foods.while we ate there was a singer who came in to sing some Vietnamese songs and English song with Vietnamese twist on the songs and after the host sang lots of song that he chose on the spot and songs people requested.The whole night my ears were filled with pounding beats of the music. At the end the end there was a raffle ,sadly none of my family or friends got it but funnily enough the number of the winning tickets was 67 and and 68.The whole night was filled with laughter , food and joy.",
