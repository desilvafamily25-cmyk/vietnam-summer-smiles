  "evening": "after the clay mirror decorating we were going to get a grab and 2 of our drivers declined just before coming to us and finally a driver came after 30minutes altogether. when we arrived in the hotel we sat down while  mu(Shenara and Yeshara's) mum looked if one of the restaurants were open. none of them were. since we were a bit tired  we walked down the street and found an open Chinese restaurant. I ordered a noodle  stir fry as well as my sister and Caitlyn had prawn dumpling. we walked back to the hotel and while our parents got ready for a Micheline star restaurants we got ready to have a sleep over ",

  "afternoon": "This afternoon, in DIY HOUSE we made clay mirrors, we each did our own unique theme, Shenara did an aesthetic of sunshine daisies with a cute character. Me (Caitlyn), did a pastel gradient with a hint of coquette, Yeashara did a woodland nature theme. It was super fun, however, the staff didn't help that much. The clay making took us around 3 hrs to finish moulding the clay into shapes, gluing our cute flowers and characters, and glossing our mirror for our final touch."
