  "morning": "We woke up early so we could finish packing our bags and go to the breakfast buffet early enough to be early to the airport.we went down and had the usual breakfast like normal .after went to the reception to check out while our packed luggages were being brought down to shuttle bus.Finally we got on bus loaded with all our items.unfortunately half way to the air port the hotel staff called us to inform us that someone had left a backpack and it was Yeshara’s.The hotel was very convenient and organised a grab (taxi )to get the bag and deliver it to us at the airport.Thats when we realised we were very late and there was a very long queue for check in and security.so we waited in line for at least 30minutes.In those long minutes Caitlyn didn’t feel so well and started to throw up 🤮.in all that time the staff didn’t even let us go at the front and ahead threw up 3 more times finally when we finished security and check win we  had to run to the gate just board the plane,5 seconds before the gate closed .we were the last people to board .Crazy ain’t it!",
