  "morning": "This was the hardest morning of the whole trip. We had to say goodbye to Vietnam - the country that gave us SO many amazing memories. Yeshara, Shenara and Mum left the Ibis hotel earlier to catch their flight home via Bangkok. It was so sad saying goodbye to Caitlyn! We gave each other big hugs and said \"See you in Melbourne!\" It was strange - we'd been together for 13 whole days and now we had to split up!",

  "afternoon": "Caitlyn and her family stayed at the hotel a bit longer before heading to the airport for their flight via Singapore. Both groups were on their way home now, flying through different countries! We had one last Vietnamese coffee at Highlands Coffee before boarding. The planes took off, and as we looked out the window, we could see Vietnam getting smaller and smaller. Goodbye beautiful country!",

  "evening": "And then something MAGICAL happened! Even though we left at different times and took completely different flights through different countries, we BOTH landed in Melbourne next morning at the EXACT same time! Can you believe it?! It was like the universe wanted us to finish this adventure together. When we saw the big MELBOURNE sign at the airport, we all felt so happy. We were home! But we also knew that Vietnam would always have a special place in our hearts forever. 💕",

  "notes": "This trip was the BEST adventure ever! We saw so many amazing things - lanterns in Hội An, temples in Hanoi, busy streets in HCMC, and so much yummy food! But the best part wasn't the places we visited - it was being together and making memories we'll never forget. We laughed together, tried new things together, and had the best time ever. Vietnam, thank you for everything! We'll definitely be back someday. 🇻🇳💕\n\nFrom twins Yeshara & Shenara and their best friend Caitlyn - three girls who had the adventure of a lifetime! 💫",
